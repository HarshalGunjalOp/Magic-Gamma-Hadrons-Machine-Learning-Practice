# Magic-Gamma-Machine-Learning-Practice

<p>In this repository you'll see me practice classification machine learning models by classifying the data into gamma particles and hadron paricles as you can see in the database.</p>
<p>I went through different classification models including the following:</p>

+ KNNs
+ Logistic Regression
+ SVMs
+ Neural Networks

## What I Found

<p>After using the same dataset on all these different machine learning models what I found was the following:</p>

+ SVM was most definitely better than KNNs and logistic regression. 
+ SVM and neural network had approximately the same results.
+ But the neural network took 12 minutes to train on the dataset while SVM only took a couple of seconds.

## Conclusion

<p>It is better to use SVMs on a small dataset, because they are far more effective than neural networks.</p>
